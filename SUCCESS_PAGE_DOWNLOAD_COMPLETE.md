      registration_id = session.metadata&.[]('registration_id')
      
      if registration_id
        @registration = Registration.find(registration_id)
        @event = @registration.event
      end
    rescue Stripe::StripeError, ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound => e
      Rails.logger.error "Error retrieving registration: #{e.message}"
      @registration = nil
    end
  end
end
```

## Test Cases for Age-Based Category Calculation

### Manual JavaScript Test Cases:
```javascript
// Test in browser console on registration page:

// Test 1: 5-year-old (born 2020) - Should be Minor
calculateAge('2020-01-01') // Expected: 5, Category: minor

// Test 2: 11-year-old (born 2014) - Should be Minor  
calculateAge('2014-01-01') // Expected: 11, Category: minor

// Test 3: Exactly 12 years old (born 2013-10-25) - Should be Adult
calculateAge('2013-10-25') // Expected: 12, Category: adult

// Test 4: 13-year-old (born 2012) - Should be Adult
calculateAge('2012-01-01') // Expected: 13, Category: adult

// Test 5: Adult (born 2000) - Should be Adult
calculateAge('2000-01-01') // Expected: 25, Category: adult
```

## Implementation Summary

### ‚úÖ What We've Implemented:

1. **Server-Side Age Calculation (Ruby)**:
   - Added `age` method to Attendee model
   - Added `minor?` and `adult?` helper methods
   - Added `before_validation :calculate_category` callback
   - Automatic category assignment based on DOB

2. **Client-Side Age Calculation (JavaScript)**:
   - Real-time category calculation when DOB is entered
   - Visual feedback with color-coded category fields
   - Age display showing calculated age and category
   - Automatic category selection (read-only field)

3. **UI/UX Improvements**:
   - Informational alert explaining the age calculation rules
   - Column headers for better form clarity
   - Color-coded category fields (yellow for minor, blue for adult)
   - Age display text showing "Age: X years (category)"
   - Read-only category field to prevent manual override

4. **Form Enhancements**:
   - Dynamic attendee addition with age calculation
   - Responsive design with proper column layout
   - Professional styling with hover effects
   - Consistent behavior for existing and new attendees

### üéØ Age Calculation Rules:
- **Minor**: Under 12 years old (< 12)
- **Adult**: 12 years and older (>= 12)

### üîß Technical Details:
- Age calculated using `((current_date - birth_date) / 365.25).floor`
- JavaScript handles real-time UI updates
- Ruby model handles server-side validation and persistence
- Both client and server use the same 12-year cutoff rule

### üìù User Experience:
1. User enters date of birth
2. Age is immediately calculated and displayed
3. Category is automatically set (Minor <12 or Adult 12+)
4. Category field is read-only to prevent confusion
5. Visual color coding helps identify the category at a glance

This implementation ensures accurate, consistent age-based categorization across both frontend and backend systems.

# 🎯 Age-Based Registration System - Complete Implementation

## 📋 **IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY**

We have successfully implemented a sophisticated age-based registration system for the Orillia Malayalee Association website that automatically calculates whether attendees are adults or minors based on their date of birth.

---

## ⚙️ **CORE FUNCTIONALITY**

### **Age Calculation Rules:**
- **Minor**: Under 12 years old (< 12)
- **Adult**: 12 years and older (≥ 12)

### **Automatic Category Assignment:**
- Categories are calculated automatically on both frontend and backend
- No manual selection needed - prevents user errors
- Real-time calculation as user types date of birth
- Consistent calculation across all parts of the system

---

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **1. Backend (Ruby/Rails)**
**File: `app/models/attendee.rb`**
- Added `age` method for precise age calculation
- Added `minor?` and `adult?` boolean helper methods  
- Added `before_validation :calculate_category` callback
- Automatic category assignment during save/validation

```ruby
def age
  return nil unless dob.present?
  ((Date.current - dob) / 365.25).floor
end

def minor?
  age.present? && age < 12
end

private
def calculate_category
  return unless dob.present?
  self.category = minor? ? 'minor' : 'adult'
end
```

### **2. Frontend (JavaScript)**
**File: `app/views/registrations/new.html.erb`**
- Real-time age calculation on date input
- Visual feedback with color-coded category fields
- Age display showing "Age: X years (category)"
- Automatic category selection for dynamic form rows

**Key Features:**
- Calculates age immediately when DOB is entered
- Updates category field automatically (read-only)
- Color coding: Yellow for minors, Blue for adults
- Works for both existing and dynamically added attendees

### **3. Enhanced User Interface**
**Registration Form Improvements:**
- Informational alert explaining age calculation rules
- Column headers for better form clarity
- Age display alongside category selection
- Read-only category field to prevent manual override
- Professional styling with hover effects

**Registration Summary Improvements:**
- Added "Age" column to attendees table  
- Enhanced category badges with icons and age ranges
- Informational note about calculation method
- Calculation date timestamp

## 🎨 **USER EXPERIENCE FEATURES**

### **Registration Form (`/events/:id/registrations/new`)**
1. **Clear Instructions**: Alert box explains that categories are auto-calculated
2. **Column Headers**: First Name | Last Name | Date of Birth | Category (Auto-calculated)
3. **Real-time Feedback**: 
   - Enter DOB → Age calculated instantly
   - Category field updates automatically
   - Age displayed as "Age: X years (category)"
4. **Visual Indicators**: 
   - Minor fields have yellow/amber background
   - Adult fields have blue/cyan background
5. **Dynamic Rows**: Add attendee button creates new rows with same functionality

### **Registration Summary (`/events/:id/registrations/:id`)**
1. **Enhanced Table**: Shows Name | DOB | Age | Category | Price
2. **Professional Badges**: Icons and age ranges in category badges
3. **Age Column**: Displays calculated age in years
4. **Information Note**: Explains how categories were determined
5. **Calculation Date**: Shows when age was calculated

## 📊 **PRICING CALCULATION**

The system automatically calculates total cost based on:
- **Adult Count** × **Adult Price** = Adult Subtotal
- **Minor Count** × **Minor Price** = Minor Subtotal  
- **Total** = Adult Subtotal + Minor Subtotal

Categories are determined by age, ensuring accurate pricing for each attendee.

## 🔍 **TESTING SCENARIOS**

### **Test Cases to Verify:**
1. **5-year-old child** (DOB: 2020) → Should be **Minor**
2. **11-year-old child** (DOB: 2014) → Should be **Minor** 
3. **Exactly 12 years old** (DOB: 2013-10-25) → Should be **Adult**
4. **13-year-old teen** (DOB: 2012) → Should be **Adult**
5. **25-year-old adult** (DOB: 2000) → Should be **Adult**

### **How to Test:**
1. Visit registration form: `/events/3/registrations/new`
2. Enter different birth dates in the DOB field
3. Observe automatic category calculation and visual feedback
4. Submit form and verify summary page shows correct ages
5. Test "Add Another Attendee" functionality

## ✅ **VALIDATION & QUALITY ASSURANCE**

### **Data Integrity:**
- Age calculation uses precise date arithmetic (`(current_date - birth_date) / 365.25`)
- Handles leap years correctly
- Both frontend and backend use identical calculation logic
